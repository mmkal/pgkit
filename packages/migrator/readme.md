A cli migration tool for postgres sql scripts, using [slonik](https://npmjs.com/package/slonik).

## Motivation

There are already plenty of migration tools out there - but if you have an existing project that uses slonik, this will be the simplest to configure. Even if you don't, the setup required is minimal.

The migration scripts it runs are just `.sql` files. No learning the quirks of an ORM, any niche library's DSL.

This isn't a cli tool - it's a cli tool _helper_. Most node migration libraries are command-line utilities, which require a separate `database.json` or `config.json` file where you have to hard-code in your connection credentials. This library uses a different approach - it exposes a javascript function which you pass a slonik instance into. The javascript file you make that call in then becomes a runnable migration script.

## Usage

```bash
npm install --save-dev @slonik/migrator
```

Then in a file called `migrate.js`:
```javascript
const {setupSlonikMigrator} = require('@slonik/migrator')
const {createPool} = require('slonik')

// in an existing slonik project, this would usually be setup in another module
const slonik = createPool(process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING)

const migrator = setupSlonikMigrator({
  migrationsPath: __dirname + '/migrations',
  slonik,
  mainModule: module,
})

module.exports = {slonik, migrator}
```

By setting `mainModule: module`, `migrate.js` has now become a runnable cli script via `node migrate.js` or just `node migrate`:

```bash
node migrate create users
```
This generates placeholder migration sql scripts in the directory specified by `migrationsPath` called something like `2019-06-17T03-27.users.sql` and `down/2019-06-17T03-27.users.sql`.

You can now edit the generated sql files to `create table users(name text)` for the 'up' migration and `drop table users` for the 'down' migration.

```bash
node migrate up
```

The `users` table will now have been created.

```bash
node migrate down
```

The `users` table will now have been dropped again.

To run migrations programmatically, you can import the `migrator` object, say in a `seed.js`.

```javascript
import {migrator, slonik} from './migrate'
import {sql} from 'slonik'

export const seed = async () => {
  const migrations = await migrator.up()
  if (migrations.some(m => m.file.endsWith('.users.sql'))) {
    await slonik.query(sql`insert into users(name) values('foo')`)
  }
}
```

## Configuration

parameters for the `setupSlonikMigrator` function

| property | description | default value |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| `slonik` | slonik database pool instance, created by `createPool`. | N/A |
| `migrationsPath` | path pointing to directory on filesystem where migration files will live. | N/A |
| `migrationsTableName` | the name for the table migrations information will be stored in. You can change this to avoid a clash with existing tables, or to conform with your team's naming standards. | `migration` |
| `log` | how information about the migrations will be logged. You can set to `() => {}` to prevent logs appearing at all. | `console.log` |
| `mainModule` | if set to `module`, the javascript file calling `setupSlonikMigrator` can be used as a CLI script. If left undefined, the migrator can be used programatically. | `undefined` |

## Implementation

Under the hood, the library thinly wraps [umzug](https://npmjs.com/package/umzug) with a custom custom slonik-based storage implementation. This isn't exposed in the API of `@slonik/migrator`, so no knowledge of umzug is required (and the dependency might even be removed in a future version).
